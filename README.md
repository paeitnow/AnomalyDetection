# Anomaly Detection Algorithms Project

This project contains a series of algorithms developed for signal anomaly detection, period optimization, correlation, and other analyses related to time-series signals.

## Folder: `algorithms_axel`

The folder [algorithms_axel](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel) includes algorithms developed by Axel, designed to process time-series data and detect anomalies. These algorithms cover various areas, such as:

- [**Moving Windows**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/moving_window): Methods for smoothing and detecting anomalies in signals using moving window techniques.
- [**Derivatives**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/derivatives): Calculating signal derivatives to identify sharp changes or trends.
- [**Autocorrelation**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/autocorrelation): Algorithms to compute autocorrelation in signals to identify repeating patterns or anomalies.
- [**Period Calculation**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/period_calculation): Tools to find significant periods in signals using different approaches.
- [**Period Comparison**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/comparison): Algorithms to compare different periods of the signals to detect similarities or anomalies.
- [**Correlation**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/correlation): Calculating the correlation between signals and methods for identifying potential anomalies in their patterns.
- [**Optimization**](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/algorithms_axel/optimization): Methods to optimize performance in anomaly detection by adjusting thresholds or evaluation metrics like `Recall` or `F1 Score`.

## Guidelines for Collaborators

Before diving into the algorithms, it is recommended to read the `README.md` files inside each subfolder of the [`algorithms_axel`](https://github.com/paeitnow/AnomalyDetection/tree/main/alorithms_axel) folder, where the input parameters, algorithm logic, and usage examples are explained in more detail.

This summary provides a quick overview of the types of algorithms available and the areas where they can be applied.
